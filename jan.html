	For the most part, I'm still on track for my SMARTR goal. Below is a breakdown of the steps.<br /><br />
<li>Going to national finals and placing in the top 3: We did make it to nationals, however in 10th. The main part of this step was really to go to nationals, but I'll still be going for top 3. We qualified 10th, but before Networking scores we were in 5th. Our networking member (Khang) is studying up to make sure we don't drop in it in the future and I'm revising the club documentation so I have proper paperwork for finals.</li>
<li>Gaining a stronger proficiency in at least one programming language: This is what I imagine I'm gonna be putting off the most, however at least novice ability in a language like C++ may be beneficial to a company</li>
<li>Attending at least one hackathon: CodeDay DC pseudo-fills this requirement, but not really. Unfortunately CyberPatriot regionals were the same day as MHacks and PennApps, which are pretty much the two biggest hackathons. I could probably go to Minor League Hacking and Major League Hacking to find another hackathon (currently Minor League points to Major League due to renovations)</li>
